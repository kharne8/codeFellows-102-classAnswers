1.How is a hardware hack different than a software hack?
  A hardware hack is a physical manipulation of a device's components, whereas a software hack is the exploitation of vulnerabilities in software or operating system.
2.What are the two ways for spies to alter a computer’s hardware?
  2 ways spies can alter  computer hardware are:
    Physical tampering: This involves physically accessing the computer and making changes to its components
    Remote manipulation: This involves remotely accessing a computer and making changes to its firmware or BIO
3.Explain how the hack worked.
  The chinese hacker infiltrated chips during the manufacturing process into servers used by american companies and gave them back door access to them
4.How were investigators able to trace the chips back to the source?
  The investigators were able to trace the chips back to the source by conducting. They used a variety of techniques, including: Microscopic examination, chip reverse     engineering, network analisys and by conducting investigators were able to gather information that helped them to understand the scope of the attack and identify the     potential suspects.

1.Which is better in a CPU, more cores or higher speed? Under which circumstances is that true? How many CPU cores does a computer need?
  More cores or speeds depends on the task at hand. is better for running multiple tasks at the same time, such as video editing, rendering or running virtual machines,   while more high clock speed is better for running games. A computer needs at least 1 core.
2.What details are you looking for when finding a motherboard which fits your processor?
  Again depending on the needs of the task the computer will be fullfilling. But the most important thing to look for is is socket and chipset compatibility.
3.What are the tradeoffs you’d evaluate while selecting a storage device?
  In this time and age solid state drives have become more standart in the industry and the main concern would be size and cost. 
4.Think about others with a background similar to yours. How would you explain to them the key parts of a computer, in a way they’d best connect with?
  A computer is like a robot that can do many things for us, like playing games, helping us learn and explore the internet. It has different parts that work together to   make it work such as:
  The CPU it's like the brain of the computer and it tells the computer what to do.
  The memory is like the computer's notebook, it helps the brain remember things it needs to do.
  The hard drive is like the computer's closet, it stores all the computer's clothes (information) so it can wear them (use them) when it needs to
  The power supply is like the heart because it's connected to all the vital parts of the computer and it makes sure they all have enough power to complete their           purpose.
